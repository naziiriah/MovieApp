# Getting Started with The Movie App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App].

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `Test`
npm run cy:open

Launches the test runner in the interactive mode.
I used Cypress for Handling test,
Before running E2E tests, ensure that your local development server is up and running. Cypress is optimized for local development, allowing you to test and develop simultaneously.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
